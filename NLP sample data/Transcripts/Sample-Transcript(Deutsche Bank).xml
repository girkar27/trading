--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All right. I think we will start. Good morning. And we are delighted to host James von Moltke here today, the CFO of Deutsche Bank. And we will use the first 30 minutes in our conversation kind of running through key topics, but we will also open for questions for the last 15 minutes.
================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So James, let's start kind of looking back a little bit. As you've been with Deutsche Bank for almost 1 year, having spent 8 years at Citigroup before, what are the analogies or the -- particularly, when you think about the restructuring that Citigroup has gone through to successful restructuring that they've gone through and now what you see at Deutsche?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. Happy to, and thank you for hosting, Magdalena, this morning.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Delighted to be here. Look, the 2 institutions are actually very similar in their business composition, obviously, the regulation, some of the remediation work that's taken place over the years. And so for me actually, there was a reasonably high degree of familiarity coming into this role relative to what I've seen and lived through at Citi. If I think about the restructuring that the 2 institutions have gone through, again, it's very similar and the playbooks are quite similar. So as I look at it, the experiences that I have at Citi gave me: a, the playbooks; but b, also the confidence that we have it in our power to complete the restructuring at Deutsche Bank. I don't like to go into direct comparisons because that's speaking about another institution, which I don't think is the right thing to do. But the playbooks are very clear and, therefore, a lot of the work that's underway at Deutsche Bank is very familiar to me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Very good. So let's now move to the business strategy. When you look at the broad CIB business and you look at the kind of portfolio that you currently kind of have and when you think about the revenue power going forward, how do you assess your mix of businesses, particularly in that kind of broad segment? And also, are there other areas you're likely to emphasize, deemphasize as time goes, as market changes, as you kind of reassess the return potential?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure, sure. Listen, last year, as you know, was a challenging revenue environment for a lot of our businesses in CIB, and that's something that we're acutely conscious of. Overall, there are good businesses with good market positions in their various activities. So for us, at least in part, the future depends on how the business environment progresses for the businesses we're in. Market is a little bit better in 2018 than it was in 2017, particularly as we think about the Global Markets business volatility, but more broadly corporate activity, the level of confidence in boardrooms, economic growth, all of those things drive improvements in the environment for CIB. As you're referring to our strength has tended to be in Global Markets and within Global Markets FIC. And so we're probably a little bit concentrated in that area. But we also have business strength and, for example, Global Transaction Banking and -- as well as Corporate Finance, which we view to be areas that are going to be subject to secular growth -- benefit from secular growth in the years ahead. And so I would see some degree of rebalancing that would happen naturally in our businesses. And then, of course, we'll take some actions to make sure that we're deploying capital, balance sheet, resources against clients in the places where we see the best returns and the best growth profile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So you're very much committed to the kind of a waterfront coverage across FIC, across the corporate side as well as you look at it going forward?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I don't love the expression waterfront coverage because it suggests indiscriminate commitment of resources, and that's not how I think about it, not how we, as a management team, think about it. So we want to be more discriminating about where we put our balance sheet to work, about the clients that we serve, the products, the markets we serve them in. So that's something that is very much part of our planning and being disciplined in that commitment of resources. That's a real focus for us. So I don't like waterfront.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  That's fine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Waterfront also suggests -- there clearly is a scale and an element of the competitive environment that we're in, and so we're self-aware about that. And there we do have a scale disadvantage and to some degree a home market disadvantage relative to our U.S. peers, in particular that makes it hard to be competing across the waterfront. We think we are a strong competitor in a lot of our products, in a lot of markets, but waterfront isn't the word I gravitate to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  That's fine. So let's focus on the equity business. It's been one of your kind of portfolio underperformance. You -- over the years, you -- kind of you've mentioned a couple of reasons the electronic trading was one of them -- was one of those. Where are we likely to see that business going from here, in your mind?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure, sure. Well, I mean, as a starting point, the market is very focused on the degree to which over the past several years we've lost market share. And I'd say, on the whole, certainly the data that we're looking at, I think, it's -- coalition data is getting ready to be published. We feel good we held market share last year in FIC, which I think was a good performance. Clearly, lost some market share in equities and that's actually been a trend for a couple of years. To your question, I look at 3 or 4 different drivers of what has brought down revenues in equities: one is that the wallet has been challenged, depending on which year, but certainly 2 years in a row now in equities; the second is that we were probably from a geographic perspective exposed to the markets that hadn't seen growth or saw the wallet has declined by more; thirdly, idiosyncratically, the experiences we went through in 2016, some clients pulled away from us, what we call sort of an idiosyncratic driver; and then fourthly, technology, which particularly in equities the consistency of your investment in technology across the stack sort of front-end technology, algorithmic direct market access capabilities all the way back to clearing in settlements. It's a significant investment requirement. We've been working to remediate that. We've also made some management changes, and so have some new players on the field that we think will be good investments. And then as it relates to the technology, one of the gratifying things in a business like equities is you relatively quickly see the benefit of technology investments. I actually was -- I traveled to Australia recently, where we have frankly a leading franchise in investment banking generally in a very strong equities franchise. And it was interesting we put in a new clearing system in 2017. Essentially, immediately, we saw the benefit because our Australian equities franchise did very well in the volatility that we saw in the first couple of months of the year, just in throughput of transactions and our customers' ability to engage with us, particularly in DMA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You've mentioned a couple of minutes ago the kind of slightly more constructed background for the industry in 2018, but let's kind of bring it down to Deutsche Bank kind of levels. You've mentioned volatility, you've mentioned better capital markets. But how has this year been so far for you?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. Well, I'll give you some data points and, hopefully, create some useful comparison, particularly to last year. I think a point to take away is we did have a relatively strong quarter last year, so we're facing a more difficult comparison. And I guess, a couple of just -- I wouldn't be a CFO if I didn't make sure I highlighted some mechanical things that go through our numbers. One is that we report in Euros, and about 40% of our revenue base in CIB is either dollar denominated or linked to dollar. So we are facing 15% more or less, and it's kind of quarter-to-date FX differential, which if you translate that into the CIB revenue base for us, leads to round numbers, about a 300 million headwind or 6%, just apples-to-apples FX neutral performance. The other thing that we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now is the impact of changes in our funding costs that have come through. And so again, year-on-year comparison, that will be a weight on the CIB business -- businesses. An estimate there would be about EUR 150 million. So we do have a headwind on a year-on-year comparison before you get to business performance of about EUR 450 million. And the last comparison we had was a gain on the sale in BATS, which was a stake that we and others in the industry held when they went public. We got about EUR 80 million gain. So you have to sort of -- to create the comparison, you got to adjust for those things. On that comparison, as I say, the market environment volatility generally constructive environment, means that we're sort of depending on the business flat to slightly down from last year. Again, a good quarter. And in that, you see some rotation. So we had an outstanding quarter last year in credit. That's going to come off. Other areas, you'll see better and poor performance. So that rotation puts us more or less where our guidance was on February 2 when we released earnings, which means reasonably solid performance, slightly behind last year in the businesses. Beyond that, we've guided now for a couple of quarters that our GTB franchise has been going through a repositioning, and so you still see the year-on-year sort of impact of that. And we expect that eventually to wash through and begin to see growth as we go through the year. So certainly, the guidance for Q1 there would hold. And then the last comment on CIB is Corporate Finance, as I think you will have seen in the publicly available data, the Corporate Finance market has come off a little bit from last year's first quarter, which we'll participate in -- although actually the underlying business performance has been strong, again, corporate activity, our pipelines are encouraging, but to some degree, we will ride with the tide in terms of the revenues booked. The last thing I would say and this goes outside of CIB, which, again, is the focus given the relative size, but I think and we've put this in some of our outlook statements in the annual report last week, the consumer business, so PCB is, I think, performing very much in line with our expectations. But this year is one in which some unusual revenues that we called out, particularly restructuring benefits won't repeat. So that's something the market should be aware of. And we're making investments in that business. And we've talked about in the past that as we get ready now to complete the merger of Postbank and the German retail and commercial bank, we're also investing not just in that, but in other areas. And so that's also going to be a driver that we'll see in this first quarter and in the full year in PCB.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PCB, which kind of -- which leads us very nicely to the next question because, of course, we've got a merger with Postbank kind of in the full swing. In kind of March last year, you talked about EUR 900 million synergies from 2022 as their -- as beyond as a combined kind of entity operate. Could you give us an update of where do we actually stand within that combination process? And maybe just for us what are you kind of happier with versus challenges you may encounter combining actually 2 very sizable institutions?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. Well, it's -- I'm happy to report that we are on track with our goals there. One of the things that I think we are -- all of us are conscious of is just the need to lay out the strategic path for the company and execute on that path. And so I think the progress that we've been making on the DWS IPO, the progress we're making on the merger of the German retail and commercial banks, I think those are important proof points, both internally and externally for our progress. We're pleased with the progress that we're making. It's a complicated merger for a variety of reasons. It's in Germany. It's got unions and public officials. It's quite an independent company that exists around Postbank because originally it was going to go on to an independent existence. So it's a complicated integration. But we're on track for the legal merger in May, and I think that then sets us on a path to executing on some of the synergies that we've announced. I'd love for it to be quicker, but the environment that we're in and the need to just progress extremely deliberately to do so in a strong consensus with stakeholders means that you want to succeed steadily and patiently, and I think we're on a good track to execute on the plans we've laid out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. And if we can talk a little bit about your technological investment, not only what you've done so far, but also your plans one of kind of key ingredients also from the perspective of the controlling the cost base going forward, kind of, you gave us a couple of examples, but it has been the last 1.5 days has been 30%, 40% about technology and how it changes banking going forward and what the potential opportunity it is? And could you just tell us how that kind of looks for Deutsche at the moment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Well, I looked at your research on it, and I will say that we're obviously not communicating enough about what we're doing on the technology side to rate more highly. So here's a chance. Yes. No, it's a fundamental sort of investment in our company that we're making. We do disclose a number -- in fact, you picked up in the research of spending, investing depending on how you look at it, EUR 5 billion in technology. And I think about it in 3 buckets. And by the way, that includes amortization, that includes current spend and that includes the investment spend in new technologies. So big, big investment. I put it into 3 buckets. One is, what I call sort of, foundational investment of improving just the core of what we do. And there we've made tremendous progress. If I think back to -- again, I didn't live this history, but where the company was 2 or 3 years ago and the progress that's being made in systems, systems' abilities, sort of processing capabilities, it's in a very different place. There is ongoing investment in foundational capabilities, but we made a lot of progress there. Then, there is a set of capabilities that we need to develop around, what I call, business improvements. And that's just whether that's operating more efficiently, more straight through processing for customers, whether that's addressing some of the regulatory and controlled remediation that we have, we've, again, there made a significant progress. Although I'd say that we haven't really crested yet in terms of the need for investment there. So there's ongoing improvement in data, in our ability to reduce the number of applications, move those applications to the cloud and just get much more efficient in terms of our state that both serves our clients and helps us to manage the company in a safe and sound manner. The third thing then is what gets a lot of attention, which is investment in innovation. I'm always a little bit -- it's -- there's lots of shiny objects out there in terms of what people do on the innovation side and by the way, we've got plenty of that that's either underway or has been rolled out. And I'd say that we're a leader in -- certainly in the German marketplace, and I think many of our products and capabilities are leading on an international comparison. And so whether that's mobile apps, whether it's special projects -- products like sort of robo-advice, we are, we think, at the forefront of innovation and we're continuing to invest. And the reality is certainly, if I think about sort of our strategic thinking here, PSD2 has put the European banking market in a position where we, in some ways, almost have to do the innovations that third parties would do on our client base and our data, now that they are allowed to. So it's -- there is an odd incentive that I think that PSD2 has created in Europe, which is to disrupt the business ourselves, to cannibalize where our own customer base to some degree. Obviously, you want to be out bringing customers to the bank with these capabilities. And that's in the more the retail and commercial side. Obviously, there is also a significant investment we talked about a little bit on the equities business in continuing to be at the forefront of things like algorithmic, trading what have you. So we do think we're investing a lot in that and evidently I can communicate more of it. One other just data point to offer was the decision we made to make Autobahn basically a public good by releasing the API. That's an important decision because there is evidence out there that public APIs that people can build to, ultimately create some platform benefits for firms like ours. And Autobahn is a very strong capability that we have, so we're focusing there also on investment in those capabilities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. When we kind of look at the -- when you look at the balance sheet to the target leverage ratio, you're talking about kind of ultimately that 4.5% that is targeted. And -- but of course, at the moment we're still sitting on about kind of 3.8%. How do you think about leverage going forward and the target leverage ratio within the regulatory context, within the -- within your business context as well?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. We're very comfortable both with the target and our path to the target. And again, leverage ratios, they're sort of in some ways flawed ratios given the risk and insensitivity of those ratios. And our balance sheet, in terms of RWA content, is a relatively low risk-weighted balance sheet. So the leverage ratio is almost, by definition, going to be a little bit more, I don't want to say challenging, well, the optics of the leverage ratio versus the CET1 will look out of whack, but that's just the nature of our balance sheet and business. I feel great about the trajectory, and we are patient about how quickly to move to 4.5%. And our plans, absolutely, give us a good path to getting there. We're actually higher than 3.8%. What we focus on and I tend to focus on is the phased in -- sorry, the fully loaded ratio, phase-in ratio is higher. The 4.5% target ultimately is a phase-in ratio, but becomes fully loaded. So we're on a fine path. I'd also say, when I talked about -- you asked about the CIB business and how we're focusing, one of the things that we're probably more focused on now than perhaps in the past was how we commit the leverage balance sheet to businesses. So there is an area where I think we're going to get more and more disciplined, and how we apply the leverage balance sheet against products, clients, markets. And so we'll probably be seeing some progress on the denominator as well as the numerator.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. I've got probably 3 or 4 more questions, but I thought I will give the audience a chance to potentially kind of ask some. So we've got the first one in the first row, Julian.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Analyst,    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is a very broad question. But Deutsche Bank has a lot of challenges. It's had a difficult and quite disappointing history. It's considered by many to have a very low ROE potential. Your personal franchise is, I'd argue, a lot stronger, you are very highly regarded as Citigroup's treasurer, and yet you voted with your feet in moving to Deutsche. So can you try and tell us what you see that we haven't seen?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. And thank you. I'm flattered but I need to prove it in this role. And look, the -- over time, you can address structural challenges. And to my mind, when I'm asked the question sort of what do you need to succeed on this path, my answer is time. I know that's not the favorite answer in this room because investors in Deutsche Bank have had to be patient. And given the performance in '17 and essentially positioning '18 as a transition year, we're asking for continued patience. Look, I said the 2 institutions were quite similar, so the playbook is quite similar and I absolutely believe that. A challenging difference for us is that the retail and commercial business on a relative basis is smaller. And so there is a business mix issue relative to certain peers. And the other thing is that our home market is structurally less profitable than many markets around the world, but Germany is really an outlier here. And so we have, in some ways, the dual challenge of how do we structure the commitment of resources, the mix of business -- businesses in CIB and the efficiency of delivery in CIB, and on the other hand be able to create a business in Germany that can be above 10%, hopefully, meaningfully above 10% in ROE terms over time. And I don't underestimate what those challenges entail. But I do believe to your point, I voted with my feet that both are addressable and can be mastered in time. And by the way going to the technology part, technology plays a part in your success in both areas. Again, efficiency of delivery on the CIB side and also the visibility of transactions and decisions that you make in terms of resource commitment at a micro level. And then quite, obviously, on the retail side, it's your distribution costs, it's your transaction costs and your ability to engage with clients, all very much driven by technology. So I do think there's an opportunity that's currently unique. But on a relative basis, we obviously have some challenges vis-à-vis peers and my history.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thank you. Perfect. So maybe the gentleman at the back and then the lady upfront.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You're in the hardest place to get a mic to in the room, but there we go.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Analyst,    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Apologies for that. So you've already told us a number of things about certain parts of your business, but you've left 2 elements of the business mix out of the picture that given the less capital intense and have a different cyclicality could actually prove quite useful, especially in transition years. So would like to hear somethings on Wealth Management. And I understand the path dependency with the Friday date, but of course, a little bit on the future of Asset Management in the business mix of the portfolio at Deutsche.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, yes. No, good question, and thank you for the question. Look, absolutely, if I could wave a magic wand and make those 2 elements of the business larger than they are on a relative basis tomorrow, I'd do it. We're obviously -- therefore, our investments and our thinking about those businesses are informed by that strategic goal. So the question is only how quickly can it happen. And on a relative basis, obviously, we do expect some growth in CIB, so Wealth Management and Asset Management would have to outstrip to meaningfully change the mix of the 2. But to your point, I think with the DWS IPO that lies ahead and the degree of autonomy that it creates and the ability to execute on M&amp;A in the marketplace, our strategic decision there is deliberately has the goal deliberately targeted at creating growth opportunities to sort of set that business free. I don't mean entirely from Deutsche Bank group, but strategically enable it to grow more quickly than it has in the past with a degree of independence from the group. Wealth Management is a good one. I think we are underweight there. We've actually, in some cases, sold. As you may recall, there was a sale in the U.S., so we shrunk a little bit. But there was a mandate there as well to grow that business, and it's an area we're investing. We've actually there by the way going back to the technology point. We have now implemented a new technology platform in Wealth Management, so it supported. Over time, it will become sort of closer to a single core platform for Wealth Management globally. We think that will enable performance over time. But it's definitely an investment area, and we'd like to see it grow and grow quickly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. Sorry, just the second row here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Analyst,    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Three questions. First, your sort of future of Deutsche Bank is largely geared toward the operating environment and have you got a Plan B if the environment is not turning like you hope? Second question is on salary, you have increased compensation this year and I hope that this would translate into better revenue. And what if this not happened, do you have the flexibility to reduce the compensation another time? And my third question is on DWS, what about the potential consolidation, is another Asset Management player?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So perhaps I'll go -- so Plan B, I -- we are always refining the business model. I think the market always thinks of Plan B as being something sort of radical, and it goes a little bit to the use of the terminology waterfront. We are executing on adjustments to the business essentially on an ongoing basis. And we will take some actions to prune the business this year, as part of just making sure that we get a cost base that's better aligned to the revenue base -- the revenue that we have and that we see in the foreseeable future. The cost income ratio that we operated on last year is not sustainable, and so we need to improve it. But we -- look, we see that a lot of our businesses are highly interconnected, and so yes, you can go at it with resource with some degree of pruning and adjustments in the business. But an attempt to do something radical is very challenging, difficult and can be painful activity. And so it's -- while it's something you have to give thought to and always looks at contingency planning, it's not something that we think is advisable and the right thing either for the franchise or for shareholders. On compensation, I wish that compensation were frankly more flexible than it is. One of the challenges we have as European bank is we live under the CRD4 requirements. CRD4 has -- I don't know if it was unintended, but it was certainly in some ways an unwelcome consequence that it made the cost base more fixed, less variable. And then we have a relatively high component of deferral. I think deferral is good in some ways in terms of tying employees to the performance of the company as a whole. So it's absolutely desirable. But we probably have too great an element of deferral over too long a period of time. So one of the things that I have started to do, again, consultation and partnership with my colleagues that is to adjust that a little bit to bring more compensation into the current year, and so create more flexibility in that expense base over time. So you've seen us taking a start at that. Incidentally, that's a little painful because it increases in year costs for a period of time and the benefits then roll out over time. And we also need to be very judicious about where we are investing and compensating against performance. And so again, by reducing workforces, compensating more highly against performance, you are constantly making adjustments. Your third question, sorry, it was a DWS-related question about consolidation?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Absolutely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Being an independent company with a listing and some degree of capital flexibility is deliberately positioning DWS to be a consolidator in the marketplace. And so I think that's a -- I don't want to go too deeply into the equity story because it's probably illegal and not the forum, but it does position it to be a consolidator. In that marketplace though, remember Asset Management is an interesting sort of M&amp;A world, right, where you can go from relatively small ticket transactions where you require a capability that you would like to have and don't have and would like to grow, it doesn't need to be high cost all the way to larger sort of an equity mergers between larger platforms. I think there's a range of outcomes that lie ahead, and it's hard to foresee which path the company will go down. But our goal is to continue to consolidate the company because it's a valuable. To the earlier question, it's a revenue stream, it's capital light, it's higher margin and it's higher growth we think than many of our businesses. And so it's a business we absolutely want to continue to participate in strategically.

  This is a question about litigation risk. So between the third and fourth quarter, the estimable and likely number went up from EUR 1.4 billion to EUR 2.4 billion reserves, all due to civil litigation. Now there are 2 ways we could interpret that, and I want to know which one. First is John Cryan's promise that you're going to -- you're getting near to settling things. It's happening. And all things are on the table, offers are on the table, settlement offers are on the table. Or the other one is that you look at similar cases, whether it's LIBOR, FX, civil litigants and you see the settlements and it's higher than you expected. So which 1 of the 2 is it -- has the bearing on the future earnings capacity?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I wouldn't go with the description precisely as you put it of either, but it's the second as you think about it. If it were visible and estimable and a change in estimate, it would have gone through the P&amp;L and be part of our balance sheet provision. And as you see, there was almost no activity in that sort of on a quarter-on-quarter basis other than, by the way, settlements that get paid out. On the contingent liability side, which is where it is potentially estimable in some range, but less than probable that there'd be an outflow that's where it increased. And there the answer is there is a very large case, which gets some attention in the media, which we think is where the outflow is highly improbable, but the number of claims that came in made the -- made us recognize a higher potential liability in the estimation. And I won't be coy, but there's a litigation related to Postbank. We typically don't talk about individual litigation items, but it's widely known and it's really the only thing that could have moved the contingent liabilities by that much.

  So non-U. S. basically?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Non-U. S, no. And it's a specific case and the case got to a statute of limitations point, so the inflow of claims increased and we reflected that in the contingent liability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. Do we have any other questions? Right here in the front row.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  It's actually an AT1 question, a more credit focused. Could you give us an update on your ADIs and things like whether the DWS IPO will actually help your ADI position on the German GAAP? I think people asked you this on the conference call back in February, but I think now we got to the point where you produce your accounts, so a clear update will be great?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes. So we have plenty of room in terms of distributable income to service the AT1 coupons. I think we published now in our final numbers just above EUR 1 billion. But we also put aside EUR 300 million in our statutory accounts into 3 banking reserves, the general banking reserves. So I think our ADI position is good and improved versus the prior year. DWS actually helped in '17 because the -- again, for German statutory accounts the impact of the reorganization into a single legal entity, which is now going to be the [list co] that's already in the rearview mirror. It was modest, but helped on the statutory accounts in '17.

  Thank you. Do we have any more questions? Okay. I'll come back to my list. When you kind of -- we've talked about the institutional strategy a little bit more, but when you look at your entire CIB business and you look at kind of from the -- trying to kind of build a kind of more -- less volatile through the cycle business. Are you building on the corporate side on the CIB? How do you envisage it's kind of progressing? You've mentioned global transactional business a couple of times. You're still one of the key global players kind of there. How would you think about kind of maybe the mix kind of shifting a little bit more towards the corporate side, which is something you've effectively talked about a year ago when -- at the capital raise?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. And this actually goes a little bit to the voting with my feet question earlier, which is looking -- as I hadn't joined Deutsche Bank at the time, looking at the strategy that John and the management team articulated, I judged that it was the right strategy and fitting to the times to the franchise and also to how the regulatory environment is changing. And within that, I mean, there was the Postbank decision, there was the DWS decision, but there was also the decision to sort of reorient and reframe the CIB to focus on -- more on corporates and also integrate coverage. I think that was the right decision. And so what we showed at the time was a split of corporate versus, what we call, institutional, but it's essentially market participants of about 65-35. And so we are -- well, the way we report our numbers we look like we're concentrated in markets and then within markets' FIC, we actually, I think, are -- have progressed well in terms of being kind of a 2/3 corporate institution from a CIB perspective and less -- I won't say reliant, but also less focused on institutional. I think that's natural to the way that the marketplace has evolved. Basically, big institutions like us, especially after Volcker and the German Separation Act, our job is to intermediate risk between the economy, the real economy and corporations and investors, the capital markets on the other side. And so the mix is natural and it's a natural role for us to be playing. And incidentally, Magdalena, to your point, a natural role given the history of the company as serving German and European Corporates Global Bank, it's a natural mix. So we're on that path. We're progressing. We do need to invest. We're investing in client coverage capabilities. We're investing in technology in our Global Transaction Bank, and we're investing in also our market supporting capabilities, but that's around risk management and risk intermediation. So I think we're on the right path there and I'm encouraged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Magdalena Lucja Stoklosa,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD   [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. I'm going actually going to kind of leave you with a very open question. What sort of frame of mind are you for -- kind of for this year, what are you going to pay kind of most attention to? And how do you think it's going to progress?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 James von Moltke,  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - CFO &amp; Member of Management Board   [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure. Well, I'm an optimist by nature, so -- and you wouldn't -- I also gravitate to challenges. So I am happy to be in the seat I'm in and tackling the challenges that we are. And again, we're making progress against those things. So my frame of mind is genuinely positive. Without underestimating the nature and scale of the challenge that lies ahead, there's no question that, that it continues. As I say, it's the transition, as I think, a tough word for investors, in particular, but it is clearly a franchise that is transitioning to a newer model and -- or a model that I described, but also one that's more efficient than it has been in the past. And that's just a lot of execution and work every day and a focus of the management team, the management board and, obviously, also our Supervisory Board and the regulators. So my frame of mind is positive. But without underestimating the challenges that are thrown at us, some of which incidentally are regulatory. So there's a lot that we're doing internally to improve our systems and our capabilities, but also as you can imagine, a lot of our energies and resources are devoted today still to dealing with the impact of regulations and becoming compliant. And so -- I mean, if I look at just what has taken place this year: MiFID II implementation had to be filed as of January 3, IFRS 9, PSD2, GDPR is coming at us. And of course, we're engaged in implementing some of the Basel III frame work issues like FRTB and ultimately the credit risk pieces. So it's a huge book of work that we're engaged in, but you make progress every day.
