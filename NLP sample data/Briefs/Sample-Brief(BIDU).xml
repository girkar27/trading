QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Operator   [1]
 Thank you. (Operator Instructions).
 Our first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

 Eddie Leung,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [2]
 Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. And many congratulations in bringing Qi to the team as well.
 I have a question on Newsfeed. I think Robin mentioned that so far you've been seeing some complementary results between search and Newsfeed. Could you share more color with us on how your marketing clients are looking at these two applications, how they are allocating their budgets between Search and Newsfeed? Should we also see a bit of cannibalization to some clients as well? Thanks.

 Robin Li,  Baidu Inc - Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO   [3]
 Eddie, this is Robin. I think when we say that Newsfeed is complementary to search and will bring incremental traffic and revenue to Baidu, it really means that many of our marketing clients, especially when I mentioned large clients in the industries of auto and real estate, they were not able to find enough number of queries or traffic to show their ads in the search context, but it's much easier for them to find targeted users in the Newsfeed context.
 And similarly, for providers of local services or education services that have a local focus, it's again easier to use Newsfeed to target their customers instead of using search. So, our customers or advertisers can actually find more qualified traffic on the Baidu platform.
 Currently, we've seen a very good adoption rate. Many of the marketing clients, are already coming up with specially created for the Newsfeed context, which is a very encouraging sign, that they embrace and like our Newsfeed product.
 And as I mentioned many times before, I think our business is very much traffic-bound, not budget-bound. So the more traffic we can provide to our advertisers, they will have more budget to match with this.

 Operator   [4]
 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead.

 Chi Tsang,  HSBC - Analyst   [5]
 Good morning, good evening. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I also want to congratulate you on hiring Dr. Qi Lu, as well as ending 2016 and putting it behind us.
 I wanted to ask you a little bit about strategy and also about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more details on some of the strategic imperatives you might put in place over the next few years and what that game plan might be.
 And relatedly, I'm wondering if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of O2O? And then on core search, you're guiding to about 6% revenue growth in the first quarter. I'm wondering what that might indicate for search revenue, and also if you can give us some color on just the pace of the recovery of the core search business this year, that'd be very helpful. Thank you very much.

 Robin Li,  Baidu Inc - Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO   [6]
 Chi, I'll give you a bigger picture on the core business and new opportunities and I'll let Jennifer address the Q1 growth guidance.
 I think we have entered the era of artificial intelligence, and fortunately we have invested in this area for the past five to six years. Actually, both the existing core business of Baidu and the new opportunities we are addressing are powered by AI today, especially for search. Five, ten years ago, when you think about search technology, it was very different. It's basically statistic-based technology. Today, search is almost all about machine learning, natural language understanding. So it's all about search. And people will be able to express their interest or queries in a much more natural way and we support voice as well as image as queries, and we've seen an increasing number of people using this kind of new form of queries to find what they need, which are all AI-based technologies.
 And Newsfeed again is also pretty much AI. Essentially, it's a technology that matches user interest with relevant content. So we find we can leverage our strength in AI technology to come up with much better products for our users.
 O2O, again, we reduced the subsidies as well as marketing costs for Nuomi and Baidu Deliveries, but we think this is an integral part of our core business. People come to Baidu search for all kinds of things, including information, content and services. And Nuomi provides the perfect content for services. And we are fine-tuning the Nuomi content as well as services and making them friendlier to the Mobile Baidu users and making more opportunities for Nuomi merchants to show up in the Mobile Baidu platform.
 So, going forward, we think we will be able to see solid growth in both our core products, which now include search, Newsfeed, O2O, and also new initiatives in terms of cloud, financial services, autonomous driving, and a few other AI-related initiatives.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [7]
 And Chi, as you recall, last year was a busy year, lots of activity, particularly related to addressing the customer base, happened in the middle of the second quarter. So as we look at 2017, I think, thinking about 2016 was not a very normal year. Maybe looking and thinking about the revenues pattern from a sequential quarter-over-quarter perspective would be more meaningful. And that I think is perhaps an easier way to think about the revenue growth.
 As I mentioned earlier, Q4 largely resets our revenue base, particularly for search business. Much of the cleanup activities, the higher requirements for our customers are put in place, and the revenue impact, as a result, is largely behind us. So as we're going into Q1 and for the rest of the year, I think the search - we have been carrying out this business for years and it does have its quarterly patterns. And thinking it in that way as a normal pattern, maybe that's a helpful way to think about the business this year.
 And this year, as we are looking towards gradually recovering and we'll drive growth in the search business, of course other than search we have the feed product that is complementary to the core search business, so that's perhaps helpful as you think about the 2017 revenue growth.

 Operator   [8]
 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

 Alan Hellawell,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst   [9]
 Thank you very much. And yes, I just want to join the chorus of congratulations with the senior management changes.
 Just with regard to iQiyi, if I'm not mistaken, we talked about a 110% growth in content cost last year and I believe Jennifer said we should expect a similar degree of growth, and I assume that's a percentage statement. And if so, would that suggest that there's a further expansion in loss margin or are there things going on in revenues that would somehow lessen that negative contribution?
 And then secondly, I was just curious, how would we view the margin profile of Newsfeed versus core search both in these early days -- and then, where would they be on a steady state basis? I assume you have content-related expenses associated with procuring news flow. So I was just curious how those two margins might compare. Thank you very much.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [10]
 Hi, Alan. Yes, as I indicated earlier, content investment will continue to be an important investment area for us going into 2017.
 For iQiyi, over the past two years, we have invested strategically and very successfully in iQiyi's content. And as you can see, iQiyi's subscription user base is growing, and that nicely complements its advertising revenue business model. So I think going into 2017, we'll continue to execute on that strategy. iQiyi has demonstrated over the years a high competency in quality content selection. And going into 2017, more of the effort will be spent in self-produced content, and that will help further strengthen and expand our subscription user base.
 From a margin perspective for iQiyi, over the past two years, their margin is actually improving, and we expect that will be the trend going forward. So iQiyi is on a solid path and I think the investment is very warranted, and they have demonstrated good returns for those kinds of content investment.
 I included in 2017 content, as you mentioned, you have correctly pointed out that we also invest in content for our feed business. The feed business product, from a margin profile perspective, is different from search. Related at this early stage, part of the investment for feed is content related, and also we will be aggressive in rolling out user adoption mechanisms for feed to be more penetrated into the user base.
 So in early stage, you know, monetization may be ramping up, but at the same time we're investing in distribution channels, in sales and marketing, as well as content for feed. Over time, as we mentioned earlier, this is also an integral part of our search service and that offers a bigger product selection for our advertiser customers and also, very importantly, offers more ad inventory if our users' adoption is good. So, early stage for feed but it does carry a slightly different margin profile, but overall it's complementary and enhancive to our search service.

 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

 Alicia Yap,  Citigroup - Analyst   [12]
 Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Qi. Thanks for taking my question.
 So my question is also related to Newsfeed. I wanted to get a sense, does the 1Q guidance that you provided includes any expectations from the Newsfeed ad contribution? And what is management expectation and target regarding how fast and how big the Newsfeed could achieve in 2017?
 And also given your comment on shifting to AI and all this content platform, Jennifer, you just mentioned about some spending, just roughly, could you get a sense how much the investment spend that we should expect related to this Newsfeed ad initiative? Thank you.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [13]
 Alicia, thank you for the question. For Q1, specifically, Newsfeed is a product that we launched for a few quarters now, and is early stage in monetization. So for Q1 guidance, we do have a small part that is contributing from feed. It will grow over the years, over the quarters into 2017 as we're growing the user base, users' time on it, the advertiser pool. And we expect Newsfeed to add more contributions to our overall revenue contribution.
 For investment related to Newsfeed, I mentioned earlier, content is one, specifically related to building up the ecosystem and provide rich content and good user experience as our users use the product and engage with our service. For Newsfeed investment, I also mentioned about sales and marketing related expenses. So this is more for user adoption.
 The investments in AI, particularly are more in the technology side, and that has to do mainly with R&amp;D expenses. And therefore, as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to invest in R&amp;D steadily but that is more gradual, it's competency build-up, it's talent, but that's not different from the way that we have been approaching R&amp;D investment over the years.

 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

 Alex Yao,  JPMorgan - Analyst   [15]
 Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the core search business.
 The mobile search MAU this quarter, the growth rate slowed down to 2% on year-over-year basis. As you guys mentioned in the past, that search is a traffic-bound business. Now that the mobile search traffic is slowing down and PC is most likely declining, how should we think about search growth outlook for the next two to three years? Thank you.

 Robin Li,  Baidu Inc - Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO   [16]
 Yes, I think the MAU for mobile search has to slow down because we basically penetrated almost all the Internet users here in China, and the penetration rate, when it's more than 50%, that the growth rate will inevitably slow down. What we are hoping is that we will continue to innovate in search technology to enable people to ask questions or enter queries in more natural ways, such as asking questions in natural language or in the form of voice, or when they take a picture, they can use that picture to search. This will increase the dependency of users to our product.
 So I think overall that the traffic growth for mobile will slow down, but we think it should be able to continue to grow over the next two to three years.

 Operator   [17]
 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead.

 Juan Lin,  86Research - Analyst   [18]
 Hi, good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Qi Lu and Linda. Thank you for taking my questions. Actually I have one follow-up question on Newsfeed.
 I'm wondering if you could share with us some metrics in terms of Newsfeed advertising and what is the current pricing policy click-through rate. And what is our strategy to compete for user time spent with our Newsfeed product, particularly in terms of user experience, when competing against market leaders? Thank you.

 Robin Li,  Baidu Inc - Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO   [19]
 I think we allow users to create designated created for Newsfeed advertisement. Therefore, the advertisers have the power to name their own price. If they don't do that, I mean, when they show the same creative words for both search and Newsfeed, we will typically apply a smart discount to the cost per click on the Newsfeed. So, on average, the click price for Newsfeed is meaningfully lower than that of Search. We're thinking about probably half of the search-related click price.
 Right now the ad load on our Newsfeed is relatively low, and user experience has been very good, versus our search-related customers, as well as those created-dedicated for Newsfeed.

 Operator   [20]
 Right, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

 Piyush Mubayi,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [21]
 Thank you for taking my question.
 Jennifer, you talked about MAU and GMV being less relevant for gauging success of the business. What would be the relevant metrics you'd look at going forward and could you give us a sense of which ones are the ones that you would share with us going forward.
 And a question for Robin. Robin, you made a push into software and hardware AI applications, including the acquisition of Raven Technology and the establishment of a few business units. How do you see this evolve? And could you talk about the shape and size of this opportunity? Thank you.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [22]
 With regards to the operating metrics, as we mentioned earlier, the mobile transition is pretty much behind us. And our services are very much penetrated into the current Internet population in China. Also, related to Nuomi services, it helps provide service-related content for our search ecosystem, and the GMV won't be a meaningful target objective for us.
 And so we will always seek to be transparent and open with our business performance and provide relevant indicative metrics to give you insight into our business. As we develop and focus on the ecosystem for Search, the service of the feed products, information such as what we commented on how many parties are registered with Baijiahao, that helps build our content ecosystem. We talked about how much of our Mobile Baidu users are using the feed product and we might share more insights as our product is tracking and giving the indicative insights into the business.
 So, with meaningful metrics that we feel is reflective of our business, we will be very open and transparent about that, as we have always been doing so.

 Robin Li,  Baidu Inc - Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO   [23]
 Yes. On the hardware, software integration, I think this is one of the most important characteristics of the AI era. With this kind of integration, - a lot of innovations become possible and the user experience is significantly improved based on that. That's why we are investing in both hardware and software for AI-related technologies.
 That is true for the mobile platform, but it's also true for the home environment as well as the auto environment. For example, when you're at home, we mentioned we have collaborated with Citic Guoan when you are watching a TV show, you can instantly ask - who is that actor? in natural language, we will be able to find the answer for you. In the car environment, we have CoDriver, we have CarLife, which integrate a lot of Internet and AI, voice-based commands in those environments. That's just a couple of examples when you integrate software with hardware, what could be possible going forward.

 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead.

 Natalie Wu,  CICC - Analyst   [25]
 Hi. Good morning management. Thanks for taking my question. So I have one question regarding your transaction-related service.
 I've seen that the GMV declined sequentially by RMB1.3 billion. But you also mentioned that the transaction service reduced operating margin by 21.8, versus 23.8 last quarter. So, just wondering, why is it that the related losses expanded, why GMV scale contracted? And also what's the management's guidance for the margin for this year? Any color would be helpful. Thank you.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [26]
 For Q4, I think the margin impact from transaction services isn?t ? it also has to do with the overall base business. As you recall, our search service, our service is sequentially a slight decrease. Normally in Q4 we would have increased. But because of all the activities going on, we didn't grow our revenue in Q4 per se. So I think that sets the base and the component for transaction services, even if it stays similar with our continued investment in R&amp;D and all that, that would translate into a bigger impact.
 At the same time, just looking at the transaction services, within it, we have reduced the spending for Nuomi-related promotional expenses. But at the same time, we see good traction on the take-out delivery service. That continues to do well. And also, included in transaction service is financial services, and we're growing that business very nicely too.
 And so I think our strategy is quite clear, and components of the transaction services, different elements are performing differently. And I think as we go into 2017, it is quite clear. I think the whole package that you're focused on, GMV and Nuomi can help search ecosystem on the service content side, and both take-out delivery service and financial services can also take advantage of the AI technology and enable business growth and also good user experience.

 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

 Evan Zhou,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [28]
 Hi, good morning, Robin, Dr. Lu and Jennifer. Thanks for taking my question.
 The question is regarding our paid subscription business on iQiyi. So you've been actually sharing with some updated paid subscriber numbers I remember by 2Q last year we have reached the target of roughly 20 million, which is the leader across this sector. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that.
 And also regarding the comments about the cost structure and profitability for iQiyi, I think, are we looking into the possibility that iQiyi can be close to breakeven in the next year or two?
 And also a quick follow-up on the content guidance comments you had just now, regarding the similar level of increase, is it referring to the percentage terms increase year-over-year or about the absolute amount of incremental cost run rate hike? Thank you.

 Robin Li,  Baidu Inc - Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO   [29]
 On the iQiyi membership question, the number of subscribers continues to grow at a very rapid rate, and we believe we are solidly number one in terms of subscription revenue and will continue to grow very fast.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [30]
 I think on your other comments, specifically for content costs for 2017, what we were trying to provide you some color is it will increase at the same rate, a very similar rate compared to last year. So over the past two years, steadily, content cost has been following a similar increase in investment levels.
 iQiyi, as we mentioned, iQiyi is doing well in its business, both on the user front as well as revenue front, and we're the market leader. So I think the business has demonstrated a two-powered engine revenue source, and I think in the near term we'll continue to invest in content and differentiate iQiyi's service. And it's tracking very well.

 Operator   [31]
 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ella Ji from China Renaissance. Please go ahead.

 Ella Ji,  China Renaissance - Analyst   [32]
 Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question for Dr. Lu Qi. So I just wonder, after you have joined the Company for several weeks, what do you think would be your to-do list for 2017? Is there any specific strategy that you can share with us?
 And then as an ordinary user, as we use Baidu products, what should we expect to see differently going forward? Thank you.

 Qi Lu,  Baidu Inc - Group President and COO   [33]
 First of all, thank you very much for your question. Since I've been here only for a few weeks, I would say I've been able to spend a lot of time with Robin, thinking about our overall Company's long-term strategy, particularly in the context of AI and China. And the focus is to land the opportunity in concrete user experience and concrete economic opportunities. That will take some time to unfold, to evolve, as I mentioned a bit earlier. I look forward to the opportunity of the coming months, speaking to many of you about those ongoing initiatives, and I have full confidence over time they will generate real user values and economic opportunities for the Company.
 And that's perhaps all I'm able to say at the time for now, but I do very much appreciate your question.

 Operator   [34]
 Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Huang from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

 Wendy Huang,  Macquarie - Analyst   [35]
 Thank you. So I have three housekeeping questions. The first, can you give us an update about the search revenue breakdown between mobile and PC? And also, how has the pricing gap between the two actually evolved over time, in terms of CPM?
 And secondly, the number of advertisers seem to be the lowest point in the past ten quarters. I assume that was partly due to the seasonality, partly due to the lingering impact from the medical advertising law. So, going forward, how should we expect the number of advertisers to trend, in Q1? When should we expect the advertiser base to normalize?
 Lastly, on the iQiyi, you recently did a CB, but I noticed Baidu only contributed $300 million out of $1.5 billion. So, previously, Baidu hold about 80% in iQiyi. So what will be the Baidu holding after this? Thank you.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [36]
 Wendy, I think we reported on the mobile revenue contribution for total revenue. So for the fourth quarter, it stands at 65%, and continues to grow, and obviously we're living in the mobile age and undoubtedly mobile is contributing more, and we do see monetization power on the mobile front growing at a much faster pace compared to PC, and we expect that to exceed PC's monetization capabilities very soon.
 On the customer front, I think you understand last year we went through the whole review of our customer base, we have much higher and more stringent requirements for our customers, for particularly the ICP license and bank account validation for enterprises. Basically we block out individuals who do search engine marketing business on our platform. So having raised the bar, it's no doubt that some of the customers may not meet that requirement. But we know it's good for our user experience, it's good for the business long term, and that's what we'll do.
 At the same time, we know the addressable market for the customers that we can service is vast, and we are innovative on the product side. So, not only search, with feed products, there is much more inventory for our advertisers, and that can serve both brand players as well as the smaller players. So we expect our customer pool to be able to grow. We will continue to have the high requirement for our customers and gradually build up our customer base, ensuring that we have high-quality advertisers with us.
 For iQiyi, Baidu will continue to strongly support iQiyi, and iQiyi is a very important content provider for our search ecosystem. With this transaction, Baidu continues to have a majority ownership of iQiyi.

 Operator   [37]
 Right, thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please go ahead.

 Thomas Chong,  BOCI - Analyst   [38]
 Hi, Robin and Jennifer, Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a quick question about the number of headcount in 2017.
 Given that we are investing in R&amp;D and in particular in AI, are we going to hire a lot more talents in China or from overseas? And Jennifer, can you give us some color about the headcount trend on an overall basis in 2017? Thanks.

 Jennifer Li,  Baidu Inc - CFO   [39]
 Yes, we have steadily invested in talent, and R&amp;D capability is really a key differentiating and competitive advantage Baidu has over the years. And we have steadily invested in R&amp;D talent. As I mentioned earlier, particularly in the AI age, with many of the AI-enabled services that we're working on, we'll continue to invest in R&amp;D. But I think from an overall headcount perspective, if you look at last year, the headcount overall has not materially changed. Obviously with more mature business, we look to the business to produce results more efficiently and therefore getting more efficiency and productivity out of our existing business. But at the same time, redirect resources to invest in new areas.
 So, overall, I think R&amp;D expenses will be a bigger component of the overall headcount. And that is how we deploy and allocate the human capital. So I think in 2017, we should expect R&amp;D trending normal patterns compared to before as we invest in AI, but at the same time, the Company is approaching workforce planning with a disciplined approach and getting productivity out of the whole way we approach business.

 Operator   [40]
